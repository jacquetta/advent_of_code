# find the power consumption by multiplying gamma rate and epsilon rate
# find the gamma rate from binary input
# find the epsilon rate from binary input
# create three variables called power_consumption, gamma_rate, epsilon_rate
# create variables for countZero and countOne and add + 1 for each number
# create variables for each bit number position
# create a list from binary.txt file
# loop through list
# loop through current item
# check each bit number in each position 
# check if first bit is one or zero 
# if bit is zero add plus one to zero variable
# if bit is one add plus one to one variable
# repeat until last bit
# check if first bit has zero variable is greater than one variable if True first bit in gamma rate is zero add to  gamma rate variable
# then add one variable to epsilon_rate variable
# else if first bit  one variable is greater than zero variable  than first bit in gamma rate is one add to gamma rate variable
# then add zero variable to epsilon_rate variable
# continue checking until last bit
# convert gamma rate binary into decimal variable
# convert epsilon rate binary into decimal variable
# to get power consumption print gamma_rate * epsilon_rate
