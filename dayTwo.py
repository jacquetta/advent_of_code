# - open and read file
# - create a dictionary to hold direction as key and integer as value
# - create two variables one called horizontal and second called depth
# - both variables will have a starting value at 0
# - will need to create a loop 
# - loop through dictionary keys 
# - create if/elif/else statements to check key 
# - if key is equal to 'forward' add value to variable horizontal
# - if key is not equal to 'forward' check to see if key is equal to 'down'
# - if key is equal to 'down' add value to variable depth
# - if key is not equal to 'down' check to see if key is equal to 'up'
# - if key is equal to 'up' subtract value to variable depth
# - continue until loop comes to the end
# - at the end print out horizontal variable multiplied by depth variable
